# Work Experience

## Magna Electronics, currently working here since 2023, Machine Learning Engineer, München, Germany

Designing object detection and segmentation algorithms with deep neural networks for automotive radar and LiDAR sensors.
Leading the development of internal general-purpose ML/DL model training and tracking framework with PyTorch and MLFlow.

## RWTH Aachen University, from 2019 to 2023, Scientific Researcher (Wissenschaftlicher Mitarbeiter), PhD candidate, Aachen, Germany

Proposed a novel transformer-inspired architecture for 3D data analysis (eg object detection, semantic segmentation).
Designed DR-SPAAM, a fast, state-of-the-art person detector for 2D LiDAR sensors. Jetson Project of the Month for September 2020. https://github.com/VisualComputingInstitute/2D_lidar_person_detection
Designed a 3D-LiDAR-based person detector that won the JRDB 3D detection challenge in JRDB-ACT Workshop at CVPR 2021.
Developed a multi-modal person detection and tracking system that is used on four robots across two European research projects.
Published 6 papers in top-tier robotics and computer vision venues including ICRA/IROS/CVPR, participated in reviewing services.
Led computer vision programming exercise (600+ participants), organized two seminar courses, and supervised 10 student projects.
Proposed a self-supervised training method for 2D-LiDAR-based detector via automatically generated pseudo-training-labels.

## Rapyuta Robotics, six months in 2017, Control Engineer Intern, Zürich, Switzerland

Developed a vision-based landing module for automated quadrotor applications, achieving robust, high precision landing under various wind conditions in simulation and field testing.
Conducted testing under various benign or adverse wind conditions in simulation and on real platforms.

## Semester Project, ETH Zürich, Prof. Marco Hutter, three months in 2016, Zürich, Switzerland

Developed a novel coverage path planning algorithm for mobile robots to autonomously explore unknown environments.
Implemented the algorithm in C++, and enabled the ANYmal to autonomously explore unmapped environments.
Published 1 paper, presented at the International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics.

## University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Prof. Timothy Bretl and Prof. Grace Xingxin Gao, from 2012 to 2015, Research Assistant, Champaign, IL, USA

Designed a low-cost, portable, GPS-based wind sensing system (best presentation of the session at the 26th ION GNSS+).
Best presentation of the session at the 26th International Technical Meeting of the Satellite Division of the Institute of Navigation.
Designed the controller for an aerial robotic system for inspecting and monitoring construction sites.
Wrote a library in MATLAB and C for common state observers (Kalman Filter, EKF, UKF, Particle Filter).
